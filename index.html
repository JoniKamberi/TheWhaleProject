            <p>Time is all relative based on age and experience. 
                When you are a child an hour is a long time to wait but a very short <br>
                time when that's all the time you are allowed on your iPad. <br>
                As a teenager time goes faster the more deadlines you have and the more you procrastinate. <br>
                As a young adult, you think you have forever to live and don't appreciate the time you spend with others. <br>
                As a middle-aged adult, time flies by as you watch your children grow up. <br>
                And finally, as you get old and you have fewer responsibilities and fewer demands on you, time slows. <br>
                You appreciate each day and are thankful you are alive. An hour is the same amount of time for <br>
                everyone yet it can feel so different in how it goes by.</p>
